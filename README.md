## Star Wars, Searching for The One!

This repository is a simple React project that provides searching capabilities 
for characters, by name, in Star Wars universe. 
The repo makes use of : [SWAPI - The Star Wars Api](https://swapi.dev/) to retrieve data for the characters.
When searching for characters, the information displayed includes : 
* Character Name
* Character Species
* Home Planet
* Home Planet Population
* List of movies where the character made an appearance
* An animated display of the opening crawl for each movie 


The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
State management is done with Redux, side effect are managed with Redux Thunk, and the global state is accessed with Reselect selectors.
Component property types are checked with Prop Types. Styling is done through 
Styled Components.
